# Requirements for the python script

Here you can find the requirements for the python scripts. I created both [environment.yml](environment.yml) and [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for maximum compatibility.

Note: The for the R's requirements please see the [renv.lock](analysis/renv.lock) file within the [analysis](../analysis) folder. I placed it there, since it works only if it is placed as the same folder as the R script.
